# Password Generator Starter Code
The goal of this assignment was to create a working random password generator. To do this, I had to create a list of criteria in which the password met. The criteria I included was uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters. I also had to include a password potential to be within 8 and 128 characters. If the password did not meet the criteria that i set, then an alert pops up stating the criteria was not met.
